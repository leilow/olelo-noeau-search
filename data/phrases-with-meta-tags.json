Late that night one of the fishermen signaled to the other to toss the passenger overboard because he was doing nothing to help with the canoe. The passenger guessed what they were up to and cried, “Oh! I forgot my cowry sinkers at the canoe landing.” Cowry sinkers were valuable, so they turned about and retumed to Kapākai. Upon landing, the passenger leaped ashore. When asked where the sinkers were, he pointed to two half-buried rocks nearby. The fishermen were disappointed (hoka) in not obtaining the coveted cowry sinkers. In another version the saying originated at the birth of Kamehameha I on a canoe. At the landing at Kapākai his mother pretended illness, whieh drew attention to herself and gave Naeʻole the opportunity to seize the newborn baby and flee with him into hiding.",

The same words were exchanged between them. So it was with ʻIʻiwi, ʻŌʻō, and all the others. ʻElepaio’s disgust grew greater with ʻAmakihi, who laughed at him in derision.

Then she tried to go to a star, but the twinkling of the stars made her feel that they were laughing at her plight. Then, when the full moon rose, she changed her children into gourds and traveled up a rainbow toward the moon. Her husband saw her and ran to grasp her ankle as she went up. Her foot slipped off like a lizard’s tail. So Lono entered the moon and remained there. On full-moon nights, the people would point out the shadows in the moon and say, “There is Lono and her gourds.” Today a mother who goes about with her flock of children is compared to Lono and her gourds.",

One day, two women saw him coming with a friend, and one said to the other, “One of those men can see, and the other is not as blind as he pretends to be.” Her companion disagreed. “I am sure he is blind,” she said. Then the first woman replied, “I will expose myself and we shall see.” When the men drew near, the woman sat down and facing the “blind” man, exposed herself. He looked and exclaimed, “A ‘ula! Kolekole!” Because of this, his friend and the two women knew that he was not totally blind.",

    "meaning_phrase": "There was a man of Kauaʻi who was inclined to be stingy and whose favorite meat was dried octopus. He would cut it into small pieces, remove the skin, and mix it into the poi. Whenever hospitality compelled him to invite anyone to share his food, he would say, “I am sorry that I have no meat. All I have is very lumpy poi. Just poke your fingers straight in and pull them up again. Push the lumps aside.” Naturally, many declined the invitation. But one day several visitors from Hawai’i who were very hungry accepted. One noticed that the host was chewing, so he stuck a lump in his mouth and chewed, thus discovering that the lumps were pieces of dried octopus.",

He found each suggestion unsatisfactory except that of his youngest son. So Lanikāula was buried in a kukui grove near his home. In the grave were placed his personal belongings, which, by the power invested in them by a kahuna, would bring harm to anyone who disturbed the remains.

Against the advice of his own high priest, Keouakuahuʻula went, taking his best warriors along with him. When outside of Māhukona, he saw canoes come out of Kawaihae and realized that treachery awaited him. It was then that he uttered the words of this saying. His navigator pleaded with him to go back, but he refused. Arriving in Kawaihae, Keouakuahuʻula stepped off the canoe while uttering a chant in honor of Kamehameha. One of the latter’s war leaders stepped up from behind and killed him. All of his followers were slaughtered except for Kuakahela, who hid and later found his way home, where he wailed the sad story.",

As the plants grew, the rootlets were allowed to spread undisturbed because they helped to hold the soil together. When the rainy season came, the whole area was flooded as far as Kalamaihiki, and it took weeks for the water to subside. The farmers built rafts of sticks and rushes, then dived into the water. They worked the bases of the taro mounds free and lifted them carefully, so as not to disturb the soil, to the rafts where they were secured. The weight of the mounds submerged the rafts but permitted the taro stalks to grow above water just as they did before the flood came. The rafts were tied together to form a large, floating field of taro.",

A wicked Puna chief once invented a riddle that no one could solve: He kī e, he kī e, mō ke kī — make! (It is the kī, it is the kī, [when it is] cut [there is] death!) The answer? The parts of the body whose names include the word kī, such as kīkala (hip) and kihi poʻohiwi (shoulder). Many people tried and failed to guess the answer and so were put to death. Finally, an old woman took pity on a youthful contestant and secretly told him the solution. In addition she told the youth about an additional kī that the chief himself had forgotten. On the day of his contest, the youth answered the chief’s riddle. Then he challenged the chief with the same riddle. A dispute arose when the chief denied that there were any other body parts with kī. The youth pointed to the chief’s fingernails (mikiʻao) and was declared the winner. The wicked chief was put to death as he had put others to death.",

After the evil beings were gone, he hurried to the canoe and sailed home. He told his friends, and together they made wooden images, hid them in the canoe, and sailed for Oʻahu, where they were welcomed. That night the images were put inside the house, while the men hid outside. When the hosts came around to eat the visitors, they bit into the hard wooden images. The Kauaʻi men burned the house, thus ending the evil on Oʻahu.",
